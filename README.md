# Heart Disease Analysis: An In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Heart disease remains a major global health concern, contributing significantly to mortality rates. Early detection and prevention strategies rely on understanding the risk indicators associated with heart disease. This repository contains an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and actionable insights.

## Insights:
* Features such as chest pain type (cp), maximum heart rate achieved (thalch) are critical predictors for heart disease.
* Missing features (ca, thal) might require imputation or exclusion.
